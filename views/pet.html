        <h1>Adoption Process</h1>
      <h2><b>How to Adopt a Dog in India: 4 Steps to Follow</b></h2>
      <h3><b>Step 1: Decide the kind of dog you want</b></h3>
      <p>Keep in mind your lifestyle, budget, home space and your family before you decide which kind of dog you want to bring home. While families with kids or young couples might opt for a lively dog, seniors can go for aged canines who require less training and can be ideal retirement companions</p>
      <h3><b>Step 2: Secure the medical records</b></h3>
      <p>Ensure that your dog is properly vaccinated. Ask the shelter to provide the medical records of the dog, detailing past illnesses or injuries/traumas, if any.</p>
      <h3><b>Step 3: Follow the official adoption procedure</b></h3>
      <p>Most shelters follow a specific adoption procedure involving an adoption form and submission of other certificates. The adoption form might ask questions about taking the dog to the vet, caring at home, vacation plans etc, as well as about the worst-case scenario – if you have to give up the dog some time in the future. You will also be asked to provide your original identity documents and address proof
       <h3><b> Step 4: Take your fur baby home</b></h3>
       <p> After requisite background checks and counselling, the shelter will finally hand over the dog to you. However, it might take the dog some time to acclimatise to the home environment. For some, it might be just a few days, while other dogs can take up to a few months. Have patience and continue showering your baby with all the love you can.</p>
